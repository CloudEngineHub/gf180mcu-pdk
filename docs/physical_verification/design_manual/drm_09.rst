9.0 Bond Pad
============

This mask defines the opening where the bond wires connect the circuit to the lead frame. The dimensions of a shrunk circuit after shrink should comply with these rules. The pad is composed of the top layer metal and pad layers. Pad metal is connected to Metal1, Metal2, Metal3, Metal4 and /or Metal5 through Via1, Via2, Via3, Via4 and/or Via5, which are located below the perimeter of the pad metal. Bond pad size and pitch are limited by assembly house.

The bond pad pitch and size should be increased whenever possible, to facilitate bonding and wafer sorting. Wafer sort and assembly capabilities may impose additional constraints. It is the customer's responsibility to take these additional constraints into consideration during layout.
