10.5 Native Vt NMOS (Optional)
==============================

This section describes Native NMOS rules. This process supports 3.3V and 5V/6V native Vt NMOS. The difference between 3.3V and 5V/6V native Vt transistor is that the 5V/6V native Vt NMOS need Dualgate layer.

Native Vt NMOS is recognized by NCOMP outside NWELL, interact with Poly2 and NAT.
