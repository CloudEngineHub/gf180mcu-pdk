12.2 Six Metal Scribe Line Guard Ring Structure
===============================================

The contact and via rings should consist of the minimum size contacts/vias placed in staggered formation with separation of 0.7Âµm within each of the rings defined by the coordinates in the table below. X=0 defines the inner (die-side) edge of the guard ring structure.
The guardring structure has been divided into two groups based the packaging process difference. The guard ring in the product uses solders bumping flip-chip need to be protected from chemical attack during solder bumping process.
