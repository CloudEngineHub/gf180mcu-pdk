14.6 Stress Relief Guidelines
=============================

The following rules and guidelines apply to wide metal lines normally used for power supply routing.

Reliability problems associated with these wide metal lines normally manifest it as dielectric film cracks and/or metal smeared as a results of stress induced due to thermal mismatch between different films in integrated circuits like metal, dielectrics & molding compounds.
