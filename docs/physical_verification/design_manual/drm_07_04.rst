7.3 Lvpwell
-----------

This drawn layer is defined for 3.3V and 5V/6V NMOS body . If this layer is used without DNWELL (outside DNWELL), the body of all those transistors will by default be connected to P-substrate potential. If LVPWELL is designed as a resistor, it is not allowed to be placed outside DNWELL.
