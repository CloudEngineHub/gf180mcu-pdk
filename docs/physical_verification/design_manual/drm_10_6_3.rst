10.6.3 Sample layout of matched pair devices
================================================

**Sample layout of matched pair transistors:**

   - Transistor “A” expected to be matched with transistor “B”

   - Total width of transistor A = 2*W

   - “D” are the dummy transistors not connected to the circuit

**Sample layout of matched pair Capacitors:**

   - Capacitor “A” expected to be matched with Capacitor “B”

   - Total area of capacitor “A” = 2* unit cell area (for Cross couple layout below)

   - “D” are the dummy capacitors not connected to the circuit

**Sample layout of matched pair Resistors:**

   - Resistor “A” expected to be matched with Resistor “B”

   - Total length of resistor “A” = 4* L.

   - “D” are the dummy resistors not connected to the circuit
