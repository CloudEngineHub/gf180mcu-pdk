MP.1,"Matched pair device layout shall be exactly identical to each other (as
shown in above diagrams)",
MP.2a,"Matched pair devices shall be of the same dimension. If the matching is
required to be 1:n ratio, then a unit cell of the same size shall be used.",
MP.2b,"For matching requirement of 1:n ratio for transistors, following layout

shall be avoided:

Expecting 1 finger device to have “n X” ratio matching with “n” fingers
(n>=2) devices.

Expecting one of the fingers of n finger transistor to be have (1: “n-1”)
ratio matched with its rest of (n-1) finger. (n >= 3)",
MP.3,"Matched pair devices shall be placed as close as possible to each other (of

course abiding by layout rules)",
MP.4,"Matched pair devices shall preferably be surrounded by one row of

identical dummy devices.",
MP.5,"Matched pair devices shall see identical surrounding around it. For

example if two NMOS in P-substrate are expected to be matched and one

of them have Nwell adjacent to it and other have P-substrate tap their

matching will not be good.",
MP.6,"Metal connection width and lengths to each identical node of the matched
pair shall be similar",
MP.7,"Matched pair devices shall run in parallel and not in perpendicular or anti

Parallel.",
MP.8,"Use cross-coupled or interleave kind of layout to create as much symmetry

in the devices as possible (see examples of matched pair layouts)",
MP.9,"Do not use smallest design rule lines and widths. Minimum device

dimensions (L and W) used for matched pair shall be 2 or 3X to the

minimum design rules in that technology for those devices.",
MP.10,"There shall not be any unrelated (not as a direct part of the device or its

direct connection) conductors (metal, poly or salicided diffusion), over or

under the matched pair devices.",
MP.11,"Matched pair devices shall not be separated by unrelated devices in

Between.",
MP.12,"Matched pair devices shall see identical DC bias at all identical device

Nodes.",
MP.13,"Matched pair devices shall have same well (either both Nwell or both

Pwell) underneath.",
