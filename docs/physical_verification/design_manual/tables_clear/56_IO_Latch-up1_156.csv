IO.0,"To flag I/O latch-up related violation:


i. Non well tap COMP directly connected to PAD is

recommended to be marked by “Latchup_MK” layer.",-,-,Guidelines

connected to Pad)",0,0,Guidelines
,FOR LV and MV,,,
IO.1,"(a1) NCOMP in PSub directly connected to I/O pad must be

surrounded by Psub tap inside the Psub without any PCOMP in

NWELL in between (Exclude the case when each NMOS

transistor have full width butting to well tap).",,,
,"(a2) It should also be directly surrounded by an Nwell guard ring

(Non broken NCOMP ring inside Nwelll). Nwell guard ring shall

be connected to the most positive supply.  Max space of Nwell

guard ring to the NCOMP in Psub directly connected to I/O pad.",15,15,Rule
,"(b) Within 15um from the edge of the NCOMP connected to I/O

pad (marked by Latchup_MK): Max Nwell tap distance to

PCOMP inside Nwell (irrespective of its direct connection to Pad)",2,2,Rule

IO.2,"Minimum recommended Nwell guard ring width:

(Maximize contact to guard uniformly.  As a guideline, ratio of

total contact area to the active area of the guard ring should be

more than 5%).",2,2,Rule
