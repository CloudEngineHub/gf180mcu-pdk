RULE NO.,DESCRIPTION,LV,MV,Comment
,FOR LV and MV,,,
IO.3,"a1\) PCOMP in Nwell directly connected to I/O pad must be

surrounded by Nwell tap inside the Nwell (Exclude the case when

each PMOS transistor have full width butting to well tap).",,,
,"a2\) It should also be directly surrounded by PCOMP guard ring

outside Nwell. PCOMP guard ring shall be connected to the lowest

potential.  Max space of guard ring PCOMP to the PCOMP in

Nwell directly connected to the I/O pad.
",15,15,Rule
,"b\) Within 10um from the edge of the PCOMP connected to I/O

Pad (marked by Latchup_MK): Max P substrate tap distance to

NCOMP outside Nwell (irrespective of its direct connection to Pad)",5,5,Rule
IO.4,"Minimum recommended PCOMP guard ring width:

(Maximize contact to guard uniformly.  As a guideline, ratio of

total contact area to the active area of the guard ring should be

more than 5%).
