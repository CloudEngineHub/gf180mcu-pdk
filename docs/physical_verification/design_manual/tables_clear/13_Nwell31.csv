NW.5,Min. DNWELL enclose Nwell,0.5,0.5
NW.6,Nwell resistors can only exist outside DNWELL,,
NW.7*,"If Nwell is used as resistor, it must be covered by RES_MK (for LVS purpose).

Width of the resistor determined by Nwell width. Length by COMP to COMP space. 

RES_MK length shall be coincide with resistor length (Touching COMP each side) and width covering the width of Nwell)""",,
