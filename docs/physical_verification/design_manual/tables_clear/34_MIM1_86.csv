RULE NO.,DESCRIPTION,LAYOUT RULE
MIM.1,"Minimum MiM bottom plate (1) spacing to the bottom plate metal

(whether adjacent MiM or routing metal)",1.2
MIM.2,"Minimum MiM bottom plate (1) overlap of Via2 layer

[This is applicable for via2 within 1.06um oversize of FuseTop

layer (referenced to virtual bottom plate)]",0.4
MIM.3,Minimum MiM bottom plate overlap of Top plate,0.6
MIM.4,Minimum MiM top plate (FuseTop) overlap of Via2,0.4
MIM.5,"Minimum spacing between top plate and the Via2 connecting to the

bottom plate",0.4
MIM.6,Minimum spacing between unrelated top plates,0.6
MIM.7,Min  FuseTop enclosure by CAP_MK,0
MIM.8a,Minimum MIM cap area (defined by FuseTop area),5*5 um2
MIM.8b,"Maximum single MIM Cap area  (Use multiple MIM caps in

parallel connection if bigger capacitors are required)",100*100 um2
MIM.9,Min. via spacing for sea of via on MIM top plate,0.5
MIM.10,"(a) There cannot be any Via1 touching MIM bottom plate Metal2

(b) MIM bottom plate Metal2 can only be connected through the higher Via (Via2).",
MIM.11,"Bottom plate of multiple MIM caps can be shared (for common

nodes) as long as total MIM area with that single common plate

does not exceed “MIM.8b” rule.",
MIM.12*,"For MIM need to identify its' length and width, use MIM_L_MK to

mark MIM capacitor's length",
Guideline,There cannot be any sensitive matching analog circuitry underneath MIM.,
