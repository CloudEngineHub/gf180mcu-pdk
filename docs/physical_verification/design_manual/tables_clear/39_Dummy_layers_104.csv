RULE NO.,DESCRIPTION,"LAYOUT
RULE"
DE.1*,"Dummy COMP exclude and dummy poly/metal exclude layers shall be drawn only if

necessary (for example for certain critical RF circuit area where RF coupling is critical).

Other wise in normal analog and digital active circuits, the presence of “dummy COMP”

Around it rather maintains the better Ioff performance of the transistors and junctions.",
DE.2,Minimum NDMY or PMNDMY size (x or y dimension in um),0.8
DE.3,(c) Maximum NDMY size  (um2),15000
,(d) If size greater than 15000um2 then two sides should not be greater than (um).,80
DE.4,Minimum NDMY to NDMY space (Merge if space is less).,20
