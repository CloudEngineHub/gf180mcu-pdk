PRES.6,Minimum salicide block overlap of Poly2 resistor in width direction,0.28
PRES.7,Space from salicide block to contact on Poly2 resistor,0.22
PRES.8*,Maximum current density of Poly2 resistor (mA/um),1
PRES.9,"Pplus Poly2 resistor shall be covered by RES_MK marking. RES_MK

length shall be coincide with resistor length (Defined by SAB length)

and width covering the width of Poly2.

If the size of single RES_MK mark layer is greater than 15000um2 and

both side (X and Y) are greater than 80um. then the minimum spacing to

adjacent RES_MK layer",20
