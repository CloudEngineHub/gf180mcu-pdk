HRES.12,"P type Poly2 resistor (high sheet rho) shall be covered by RES_MK

marking. RES_MK length shall be coincide with resistor length (Defined

by Pplus space) and width covering the width of Poly2.

If the size of single RES_MK mark layer is greater than 15000um2 and

both side (X and Y) are greater than 80um. Then the minimum spacing to

adjacent RES_MK layer",20
