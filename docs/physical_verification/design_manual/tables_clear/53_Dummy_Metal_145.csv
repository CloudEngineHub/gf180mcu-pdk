space to M1;  Dummy M1 space to Poly2)",1um
DM.6,No overlap of Dummy Metal with the Subsequent Metal layers,
DM.7,No overlap of Dummy Metal with the Previous layers,
DM.8,"There should not be any dummy metal pattern fill in the following areas

(i) MIM CAP area (recognized by Fuse Top)

(ii) Poly fuse area (recognized by POLYFUSE)

(iii) Metal fuse area (recognized by FUSEWINDOW_D)

(iv) Dummy metal exclusion area (recognized by PMNDMY)

(vi) OTP mark area ( recognized by OTP_MK)

Space from these Structures",6um
DM.9*,"Do not use exact replicates of dummy metal fill patterns for

consecutive metal layers to avoid dielectric and metal stress

problems? E.g. the Metal4 dummy metal fill patterns should not be

an exact copy of the Metal3 dummy fill pattern. (Offsets value:)",0.5um
