LRES.9,"Nplus Poly2 resistor shall be covered by RES_MK marking.

RES_MK length shall be coincide with resistor length (Defined by

SAB length) and width covering the width of Poly2.

If the size of single RES_MK mark layer is greater than 15000um2

and both side (X and Y) are greater than 80um. Then the minimum

spacing to adjacent RES_MK layer",20
