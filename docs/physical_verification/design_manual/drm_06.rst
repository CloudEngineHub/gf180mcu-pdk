6.0 Essential Tapeout Checklist
===============================

1. All layout databases given to GlobalFoundries should be in layout cell hierarchical based GDSII data.

2. All drawn and designer-generated GDS layers must be provided to GlobalFoundries by the designers for successful DRC, DR waiver and tapeout.

3. Before design data can be submitted for tapeout, the design must pass DRC.
