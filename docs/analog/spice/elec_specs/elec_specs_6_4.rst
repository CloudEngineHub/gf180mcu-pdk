6.2 MIM Capacitor
=================

Three types of MIM-capacitor are offered; they are 2.0fF/um2, 1.5fF/um2, 1.0 fF/um2. Extra mask layer (L92) is required for the MIM Cap.

.. note::
    One process is only allowed to use one type of MIM-capacitor; it is not possible to have more than one type of MIM Caps in the same process flow with just one masking step.
