2.5 Model vs. EP Nominal Target
===============================

In the following sections, the comparison of the key device parameters between the models and EP targets (YI-141-EP059) are listed for each device. The values are for 25C unless specified otherwise.

The measured and simulated results are obtained using the following bias conditions: Idsat @ Vbs = 0 and Vds = Vgs = Vdd (NMOS) / -Vdd (PMOS)

where

- Vdd = 3.3V for nmos_3p3

- Vdd =-3.3V for pmos_3p3

- Vdd = 6V for nmos_6p0

- Vdd =-6V for pmos_6p0

- Vdd = 6V for nmos_6p0_nat

.. note::
   Vth0 is the measured or simulated threshold voltage obtained using the max Gm method at Vd = 0.05V. For 6.0V native NMOS, Vth0 is measured and simulated at Vd=0.1V. Vth1 is the simulated threshold voltage obtained using the BSIM equation. These two values may have a difference.
