1.2 Model Overview
==================

GlobalFoundries' models are physics-based, scalable compact models, in contrast to models based on fitting a discrete device. This allows the greatest amount of flexibility for designers and provides good model accuracy over a broad range of applications.

Within the model files, a complete set of parameters for arbitrary device geometries is generated from a single set of technology specific electrical and process data. For this, each value of the required model elements is related to a function describing the dependence on the specific electrical data (such as capacitance per area, sheet resistivity), technology data (layout design rules), operating point and temperature. This type of physics- based model allows us to leverage the large volumes of in-line test data and provides a realistic approach to statistical modeling.

Other important features:

1. Electrical data is extracted using near-nominal process hardware
2. Statistical variation is measured using either process split hardware or distributions from in-line data
3. The electrical data comes from DC characterization (over voltage and temperature) and CV characterization.
