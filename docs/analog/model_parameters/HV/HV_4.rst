4.0 Statistical Models
======================

Uncertainties are inherent in the fabrication of transistors. The same transistor design can show different performance when fabricated using different equipment, at different locations, or during different times. In order to capture these variations of performance, a statistical model is necessary.

The following table lists statistical models that are available in this release.
